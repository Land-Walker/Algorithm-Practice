## My Approaches

### Basic Ideas
$O(n^2)$ algorithm is easy:
- for loop, iterate for n = position.size()
- nest another for loop, adding speed to position
  - remove the position that reached target
- count the number of fleet/erasing process
- output the count

But, what would be the stack solution?

Alright. Try to solve it with some help of Claude, but it didnt figure its way out.
Also, this Q uses Q739 algo, so I will come back after learning how the solution of it works.
